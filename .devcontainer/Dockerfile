# Create a directory for your code
WORKDIR /workspace

# (Optional) Copy requirements in and pre-install to speed up rebuilds:
# COPY requirements.txt .
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# By default, your entire GitHub repo is mounted at /workspace,
# so you don’t need to COPY your code here—just set WORKDIR.
